I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently tried my hand at cryptanalysis. My supervisor is Kenny Paterson.
Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with Mihir Bellare during an exchange at UCSD. I wrote my master thesis on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by Felix Günther.</description></item><item><title>Privacy policy</title><link>/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/privacy/</guid><description>Links to other websites Other websites referenced here may collect information about you, use cookies, embed additional tracking services from third parties, and record your interaction with that embedded content, including your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are signed in to that website.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/</guid><description>Peer reviewed articles M.
