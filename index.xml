I also sometimes end up doing a bit of cryptanalysis. My supervisor is Kenny Paterson.
Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with Mihir Bellare during an exchange at UCSD. I wrote my master thesis on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by Felix Günther.</description></item><item><title>Privacy policy</title><link>/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/privacy/</guid><description>Links to other websites Other websites referenced here may collect information about you, use cookies, embed additional tracking services from third parties, and record your interaction with that embedded content, including your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are signed in to that website.</description></item><item><title>Publications &amp; Talks</title><link>/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/</guid><description>Peer-reviewed papers A Formal Treatment of End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Storage

I think teaching is one of the most rewarding activities one can engage in. There is a profound joy in watching someone have an &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;-moment and see how things fall into place. I also think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to learn new things myself. Students&amp;rsquo; questions and muddy points challenge my understanding of the topic I&amp;rsquo;m teaching, and their background knowledge and insights broaden my perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
