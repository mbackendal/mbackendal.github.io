Since the Pythagorean theorem is slightly overused as an example, how about we go with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation instead?
$$ i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle $$
See? It works beautifully! We can even use LaTeX inline to explain that $\Psi$ is the state vector of the quantum system, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian.</description></item><item><title>My first post (with an image)</title><link>/posts/2021/08/31/first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2021/08/31/first-post/</guid><description>Sometimes, blog posts (or normal pages) will also contain an image, this is why we provide an example here to test the stylesheets for this.
Wikipedia says: "Monte Altissimo di Nago is one of the highest summits of the Monte Baldo mountain range and thereby part of the Garda Mountains in northern Italy." Source: Unsplash. Looks pretty good, I&amp;rsquo;d say? If we just continue this text for a little longer, we can probably also test how / if the summary feature works, and where the truncation occurs.</description></item></channel></rss>
