<q>When one teaches, two learn.</q> –Robert Heinlein  
I think teaching is one of the most rewarding activities one can engage in.
There is a profound joy in watching someone have an "aha"-moment and see how things fall into place.
I also think it's one of the best ways to learn new things myself.
Students' questions and muddy points challenge my understanding of the topic I'm teaching, and their background knowledge and insights broaden my perspective.
All of this makes teaching a fulfilling and gratifying experience.

I also believe that teaching is meaningful, by which I mean that I find purpose in doing it.
The saying that <q>Those who can't do, teach</q>, sometimes used in a derogatory manner towards educators, serves to illustrate this.
Because the truth is that none of us can do _everything_.
I will not solve all of the problems of the world, alone, no matter how hard I work.
But if I teach, then I amplify my reach and my (indirect) impact.
Students who are much smarter than me, much better programmers, mathematicians, logicians and philosophers, can take the knowledge and understanding that I have helped them acquire and go out there and do great things -- and hopefully pass on their knowledge by teaching someone else too.

## Teaching Activities
I've had the opportunity to teach a wide range of different topics, from sailing to English and mathematics.
Here are some of the more memorable experiences.
