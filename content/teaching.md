## Teaching Activities
I've had the opportunity to teach a wide range of different topics, from sailing to English and mathematics.
Here are some of the more memorable experiences.

### Thesis supervision
Master's thesis projects:
* Giovanni Torrisi, "Analyzing Cryptography in the Wild: Bitwarden", Fall 2024
* Nicola Dardanis, "Bridging the Gap: Design and Implementation of Secure Shared Folders", Summer 2024 (co-supervised by Matteo Scarlata)
* Valentina Iliescu, "Multi-Device Password Hardening", Spring 2024 (co-supervised by Matteo Scarlata)
* Léa Micheloud, "Securing Cloud Storage with OpenPGP: An Analysis of Proton Drive", Fall 2023 (co-supervised by Daniel Huigens at Proton AG)
* Younis Khalil, "Implementing a Forward-Secure Cloud Storage System", Spring 2023 (co-supervised by Felix Günther)
* Miro Haller, "Cloud Storage Systems: From Bad Practice to Practical Attacks", Spring 2022 (co-supervised by Kenny Paterson)
