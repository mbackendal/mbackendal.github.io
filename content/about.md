I will be starting as an assistant professor at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/en) (Università della Svizzera italiana) in January 2026.
Until recently I was a PhD student at ETH Zurich in the applied cryptography group, advised by [Kenny Paterson](https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjU0MDM1.TGlzdC8zMzE4LC0yODgzMDgzMDc=.html).
I wrote my doctoral thesis on provable security for applied cryptography, focused on cloud storage security [[1](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/989), [2](https://mega-awry.io/), [3](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/546)] and key derivation [[4](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/657), [5](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/935), [6](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/861)].

I am a co-founder and organizer of [CAW](https://caw.cryptanalysis.fun/), the Cryptographic Applications Workshop.

In the spring of 2025, I spent four months working at Apple as an intern in the Cryptographic Engineering team within [Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR)](https://security.apple.com/), applying my research to real-world cryptographic systems.
Speaking of real world: my co-authors and I had three talks accepted at Real World Crypto 2025!  
* [Provable Security for End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Storage](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?feature=shared&t=506)
* [Mind the Gap! Secure File Sharing, from Theory to Practice](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?feature=shared&t=1455)
* [D(e)rive with Care: Lessons Learned from Analyzing Real-World Multi-Input KDFs](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?t=28141s)

Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/) during an exchange at UCSD. I wrote [my master thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8979963) on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by [Felix Günther](https://www.felixguenther.info/).

In my free time, I like climbing and hiking in the beautiful mountains of Switzerland, trying new foods and learning languages, among other things!
