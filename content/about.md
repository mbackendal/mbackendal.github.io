I'm a PhD student (well, technically a "doctoral candidate") at ETH Zurich, where I do research in provable security for applied cryptography with a special interest in [cloud storage](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/989).
I also [sometimes](https://mega-awry.io/) [end up doing](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/935) [a bit of cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/546).
My supervisor is [Kenny Paterson](https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjU0MDM1.TGlzdC8zMzE4LC0yODgzMDgzMDc=.html).

I recently spent four months working at Apple as an intern in the Cryptographic Engineering team within [Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR)](https://security.apple.com/), applying my research to real-world cryptographic systems.
Speaking of real world: my co-authors and I had three talks accepted at Real World Crypto 2025!  
* [Provable Security for End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Storage](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?feature=shared&t=506)
* [Mind the Gap! Secure File Sharing, from Theory to Practice](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?feature=shared&t=1455)
* [D(e)rive with Care: Lessons Learned from Analyzing Real-World Multi-Input KDFs](https://www.youtube.com/live/6FQX2otSbuE?t=28141s)


Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/) during an exchange at UCSD. I wrote [my master thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8979963) on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by [Felix Günther](https://www.felixguenther.info/).

I used to be part of the board of [VMI](http://vmi.ethz.ch/), the association of scientific staff at the Department of Computer Science at ETH.
VMI's mission is to make the department of computer science a great place to work and study. If you are a prospective or current employee at the department and want to learn more about VMI, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)!

In my free time, I like climbing and hiking in the beautiful mountains of Switzerland, trying new foods and learning languages, among other things!
