Hi, I'm Matilda!

I'm a PhD student (well, technically a "doctoral candidate") at ETH Zurich, where I do research in provable security for applied cryptography with a focus on forward security.
I've also recently tried my hand at cryptanalysis.
My supervisor is [Kenny Paterson](https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjU0MDM1.TGlzdC8zMzE4LC0yODgzMDgzMDc=.html).

Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/) at UCSD. There I also wrote my master thesis on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by [Felix Günther](https://www.felixguenther.info/).

In my free time, I like climbing and hiking in the beautiful mountains of Switzerland, trying new foods and learning languages.
