Hi, I'm Matilda!

I'm a PhD student (well, technically a "doctoral candidate") at ETH Zurich, where I do research in provable security for applied cryptography with a focus on forward security.
I've also recently tried my hand at cryptanalysis.
My supervisor is [Kenny Paterson](https://appliedcrypto.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjU0MDM1.TGlzdC8zMzE4LC0yODgzMDgzMDc=.html).

Before I joined ETH, I studied engineering mathematics at Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH) in Sweden. I also worked with [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/) during an exchange at UCSD. I wrote my master thesis on puncturable symmetric key encapsulation mechanisms, supervised by [Felix Günther](https://www.felixguenther.info/).

I am currently the president of [VMI](http://vmi.ethz.ch/), the association of scientific staff at the Department of Computer Science at ETH.
VMI's mission is to make the department of computer science a great place to work and study. If you are a prospective or current employee at the department and want to learn more about VMI, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:vmi-contact@lists.inf.ethz.ch)!

In my free time, I like climbing and hiking in the beautiful mountains of Switzerland, trying new foods and learning languages, among other things!
