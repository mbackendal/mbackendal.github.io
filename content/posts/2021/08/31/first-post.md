Sometimes, blog posts (or normal pages) will also contain an image, this is why we provide an example here to test the stylesheets for this.

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/2021/08/31/monte-altissimo-di-nago.jpg">
    <figcaption>
        Wikipedia says: "Monte Altissimo di Nago is one of the highest summits of the Monte Baldo mountain range and thereby part of the Garda Mountains in northern Italy."

Looks pretty good, I'd say?
If we just continue this text for a little longer, we can probably also test how / if the summary feature works, and where the truncation occurs.
(Unfortunately, this the `.Summary` variable in Hugo does not always give the expected result...)
