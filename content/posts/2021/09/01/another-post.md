This is another dummy blog post in which we also use LaTeX.
Since the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) is slightly overused as an example, how about we go with the time-dependent [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) instead?

$$
i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle
$$

See? It works beautifully!
We can even use LaTeX inline to explain that $\Psi$ is the state vector of the quantum system, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian.
